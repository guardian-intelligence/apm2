# Test Safety Guard allowlist entries.
#
# Format:
#   RULE_ID|path
#   RULE_ID|path:line
#   *|path
#   *|path:line
#   RULE_ID|re:<bash-regex>
#
# Notes:
# - `RULE_ID` values come from crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review/gate_checks.rs.
# - `*` matches every rule.
# - Regex entries are matched against:
#     RULE_ID|path:line|line_text
# - Keep entries as narrow as possible to preserve fail-closed behavior.

# Security test fixture intentionally embeds a destructive shell payload string.
