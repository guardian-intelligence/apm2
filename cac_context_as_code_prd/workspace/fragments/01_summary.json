      "APM2 already has a signed, hash-chained ledger and a content-addressed store (CAS).",
      "Today, the system still relies on implicit or prose-driven contracts (README/Markdown/scripts) and unverified assumptions about CLI functionality.",
      "This creates unplanned context discovery, brittle agent behavior, and a slow innermost loop (code+review)."

      "implications": [
        "If context is complete and correct, code can be generated deterministically (or within controlled nondeterminism).",
        "Therefore, the highest-leverage engineering work is to make context machine-native, canonical, and enforceable.",
