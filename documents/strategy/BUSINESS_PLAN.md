# Business Plan: APM2 Holonic Foundation

This document outlines the economic and organizational strategy for Phase 3 (Company Formation), treating the software factory not just as a tool, but as a revenue-generating IP foundry.

## 1. Executive Summary
APM2 is an autonomous software factory that compounds value through recursive self-improvement. By Phase 3, the system will pivot from building its own infrastructure to generating high-value intellectual property (IP) and software products for external markets.

## 2. The Products
The Foundation licenses and operates two primary product lines:

### 2.1 The Holonic Substrate (B2B/Enterprise)
- **Agent-Authored Algorithms:** Novel methods for consensus, compression, and coordination.
- **Factory Kernel:** Licensing the APM2 kernel to enterprises for internal automation.
- **IP-Linked Software:** Products whose performance is fundamentally derived from Phase 2 innovations.

### 2.2 Teammate: The Holonic AI Companion (B2C/Prosumer)
- **The AI 'Teammate':** A proactive companion for task management, scheduling, and personalized support.
- **Differentiator:** Unlike reactive assistants, Teammate operates on the holonic substrate. Emotional calibration is implemented via the **PersonaProjection Primitive** (Versioned). This primitive takes the user's private Ledger history (Commitment Filter) as input and produces a bounded persona state projection. Continuity is achieved through deterministic reconstruction from signed evidence, ensuring it does not violate the Markov Blanket. Replay stability is verified against model-pin constraints.
- **Monetization:** Subscription-based access to the user's private holon cluster and encrypted persona-ledger.

## 3. Revenue Streams
- **Internal Transfer Pricing:** Nodes within the Holonic Network operate on a **Market Holarchy** model. Economic coordination is expressed as a bounded-authority protocol over ledger events (`BidPlaced`, `BidAccepted`, `WorkPriced`). Sub-holons 'bid' for work within supervisor-issued lease scopes and budgets. All peer negotiation channels outside the ledger are forbidden to ensure replay-auditability and prevent metric gaming.
- **Performance Royalties:** Percentage of cost-savings achieved by partner organizations using our algorithms.
- **Capacity Licensing:** Charging per-agent-hour for use of the Holonic Factory.

## 4. Organizational Structure (Phase 3)
- **The IP Ledger:** An immutable evidence bundle for every innovation, ensuring clear chain-of-custody from prompt to patent.
- **The Council of Adjudication:** Human/Agent quorum responsible for high-stakes strategic decisions. A primary Phase 3 goal is the **Industrialization of Adjudication**, where human decisions are compiled into **Oracle Primitives** (Decision -> Predicate -> Verifier -> Regression Corpus). This workflow moves toward zero-marginal-cost scaling by bounding oracle request volume, imposing oracle budgets (rate + max queue), and enforcing mandatory post-oracle compilation SLAs to minimize residual human load.
- **The Holonic Network:** A distributed corporation where nodes operate as semi-autonomous profit centers under internal economic leases.

## 5. Strategic Moats
- **Compounding Quality Delta:** The system gets better at building software faster than human-only teams.
- **Proof-of-Innovation:** Every patent filing is backed by a deterministic evidence bundle (PRD -> Gate -> Code -> Test).
- **Zero-Marginal-Cost Engineering:** As the factory matures, implementation cost is targeted to approach compute cost. This is an optimization goal that accounts for the unavoidable per-change cost of GateRuns, evidence capture, and context compilation. We track "Verifier Portfolio Economics" to ensure marginal cost is engineered down through primitive adoption and gate efficiency, preventing silent cost inflation.

## 6. Recursive Capital: The Continuous Improvement Engine
The Foundation commits to a massive and sustained investment in its own improvement mechanisms. We treat the **Foundry Engine** not as a static tool, but as a capital asset that compounds in value through:

### 6.1 The AAT Quality Loop (The Master Lever)
The biggest lever for accelerated quality is **Agent Acceptance Testing (AAT)**. Every code change is verified by an autonomous 'Test Agent' that:
- **Hypothesis-Driven Testing:** Forms testable hypotheses about the change *before* execution.
- **Strategic Alignment:** Collects evidence to evaluate how implementations align with the high-level intents in **NORTH_STAR** and the **Business Plan**. Full validation is gated by the introduction of the **Strategic Predicate Set**—a machine-checkable rubric that emits structured counterexamples and evidence receipts (replacing narrative judgment).
- **Anti-Gaming Enforcement:** Performs static and dynamic analysis to detect hardcoded 'cheating' or mock-only implementations.
- **Trust Separation:** Provides an independent, adversarial view that ensures implementation matches specification without human intervention.

### 6.2 Industrializing the Idea Compiler
- **Quality & Smoothness:** Grounding every line of code in the **Codebase Context Pack (CCP)**, eliminating 'hallucinated' abstractions.
- **Efficiency & Speed:** Developing high-precision coding skills (Agentic Rust) and prescriptive verification gates that provide immediate, machine-executable remediation.

### 6.3 Refactor Radar
- **Sustained Velocity:** Preemptively resolving complexity hotspots identifies via CCP signals, ensuring the codebase remains easier to modify as it grows.

## 7. Phase 3 Milestones
1. **Legal Incorporation:** Transition from project to legal entity.
2. **IP Audit:** Baseline of all innovations generated in Phase 2.
3. **Series A Funding:** Scaling compute and legal/business development teams.
