# Meta-Reasoning (Strategy Selection for Thinking)

**Category:** Meta-Level and Reflective Modes

## What it is

Decide how to reason: which mode to use, effort allocation, what uncertainties matter, when to stop.

## What it outputs

- Deliberation policies
- Checklists
- Stopping rules
- Reasoning strategy selections

## How it differs

Second-order: the object is your inference process and resource allocation. Reasoning about reasoning.

## Best for

- High-stakes decisions
- Avoiding over-analysis
- Building reliable org processes
- Teaching reasoning
- AI system design

## Common failure mode

Meta-infinite regress ("thinking about thinking" forever). At some point you have to think about the object level.
