# Bayesian Probabilistic Reasoning (Credences + Updating)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Represent degrees of belief as probabilities and update them with evidence (Bayes' rule).

## What it outputs

- Posterior beliefs
- Predictive distributions
- Uncertainty-aware forecasts
- Credible intervals

## How it differs

Probability as **rational credence management**; coherence arguments motivate consistency; Cox-style results are often interpreted as connecting Boolean logic with graded belief. Unlike frequentist methods, directly reasons about probability of hypotheses.

## Best for

- Integrating prior knowledge + data
- Diagnosis
- Forecasting
- Online learning
- Sequential decision making

## Common failure mode

Overconfident priors or "making up" priors without sensitivity analysis. The posterior is only as good as your prior and likelihood model.
