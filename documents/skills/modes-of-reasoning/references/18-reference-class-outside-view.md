# Reference-Class / "Outside View" Reasoning

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Predict by comparing to a base rate distribution of similar past projects/cases ("what usually happens?").

## What it outputs

- Base-rate forecasts
- Adjustment factors
- Anchored predictions

## How it differs

It's an inductive method designed to counter planning fallacy and inside-view optimism. Forces you to start with what typically happens before adjusting for specifics.

## Best for

- Project timelines
- Budgets
- Risk forecasting
- Portfolio-level planning
- Debiasing optimistic estimates

## Common failure mode

Choosing the wrong reference class (too broad or too narrow). The forecast is only as good as the comparison group.
