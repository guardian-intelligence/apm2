# Abductive Reasoning (Inference to the Best Explanation)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

From observations, propose a hypothesis that would best explain them.

## What it outputs

- Candidate explanations/models
- "Best current story"
- Diagnostic hypotheses

## How it differs

Unlike induction (generalizing frequencies), abduction introduces **hidden mechanisms/causes**; unlike deduction, it's not guaranteed. It's creative hypothesis generation guided by explanatory power.

## Best for

- Hypothesis generation
- Incident triage
- Diagnosis
- Scientific discovery
- Root cause analysis

## Common failure mode

"Story bias" (choosing the most *appealing* explanation, not the most supported). A compelling narrative isn't the same as a well-supported hypothesis.
