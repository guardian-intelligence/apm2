    "formal": "any logically irreversible bit erase dissipates at least\n[\nE_{\\min} = kT \\ln 2 \\quad \\text{joules per bit}\n]\nwhere (k) is Boltzmann\u2019s constant and (T) is temperature. Real systems are orders of magnitude above this bound, but the direction is immutable: *compute \u2192 heat \u2192 limits*.",
    "apm2_mapping": "treat **token budgets**, **tool budgets**, and **artifact bytes** not as \u201cproduct limits\u201d but as **thermodynamic proxies**: every extra tool call and every extra token is irrecoverable physical work somewhere. APM2 already encodes this as session budgets (`apm2_core::budget`) and ContextPack budgets (CAC). The missing step is to express *energy/cost* as a first\u2011class budget dimension and bind it to receipts (so \u201cwe spent X\u201d is auditable, not narrative).",
