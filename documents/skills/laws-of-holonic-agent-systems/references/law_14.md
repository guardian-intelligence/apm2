# Law 14: Proportionality and Risk-Weighted Evidence

## The Law
Gate set strength must be a function of risk and blast radius, not tradition.

## Operationalization
1. **Risk Tiers:** Define tiers (e.g., T0: Experimental, T1: Internal, T2: Security-Critical).
2. **Gate Selection:** Mechanically select required gates based on the tier (e.g., static analysis for T0, full hypothesis-driven AAT for T2).
3. **Adaptive Enforcement:** Adjust gating rigor based on measured escape rates.

## Rationale
Universal gating is inefficient. By making evidence requirements proportional to risk, the system maximizes throughput without compromising safety on critical paths.
