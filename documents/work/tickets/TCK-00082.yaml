    security: |
      No security implications. cargo-nextest runs the same tests as cargo test
      with the same permissions. It does not introduce any new attack surface.

      ### Faster Test Runner (cargo-nextest)

      [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) is a next-generation test runner that
      executes tests significantly faster than `cargo test` by running tests
      in parallel at the process level.

      **Installation:**
      ```bash
      cargo install cargo-nextest
      ```

      **Usage:**
      ```bash
      cargo nextest run                    # Run all tests
      cargo nextest run -p apm2-core       # Run tests for specific crate
      cargo nextest run --workspace        # Run all workspace tests
      cargo nextest run -- test_name       # Run specific test by name
      ```

      **Why it's faster:**
      - `cargo test` runs tests in parallel within each test binary (threads)
      - `cargo-nextest` runs test binaries in parallel (processes)
      - This provides better isolation and typically 2-3x faster execution

      **Note:** `cargo test` remains fully supported. nextest is recommended
      for faster local development but is not required.
      ```
