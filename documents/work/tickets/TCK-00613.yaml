  root_cause_analysis:
    summary: |
      CI behavior is split across two execution models:

      1. Shell scripts under scripts/ that implement lint, doc, evidence,
         and compliance checks via bash orchestration.
      2. Rust-native gates under `apm2 fac gates` that implement bounded
         test execution with containment controls.

      This split causes:
      - Inconsistent failure semantics (shell exit codes vs typed results)
      - Duplicate orchestration logic (workflow YAML + fac review evidence.rs
        both call scripts independently)
      - No unified gate registry (can't query "what gates exist" or
        "what does profile X run")
      - Script-coupled attestation (gate_attestation.rs fingerprints
        script paths, not gate inputs)
      - Shell scripts bypass bounded execution containment controls

      The fix is to build one Rust gate engine with a registry, runner,
      and profile system, then migrate all CI behavior into it. Shell
      scripts are deleted entirely.

    - id: S1_GATE_ENGINE
      title: "Build Gate trait, GateRegistry, and parallel-phase runner"
      detail: |
        Add `gates_engine/` module under
        `crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review/`:

        1. `Gate` trait:
           - `id() -> &str` (unique gate identifier)
           - `phase() -> Phase` (compile, lint, test, doc, evidence, audit)
           - `parallel_group() -> Option<&str>` (gates in same group run concurrently)
           - `run(&self, ctx: &GateContext) -> GateResult`

        2. `GateRegistry`:
           - Stores all registered gates
           - `gates_for_profile(profile: &str) -> Vec<&dyn Gate>`
           - `all_gate_ids() -> Vec<&str>`
           - Profiles: local-full, quick, workflow-preflight, drift-audit

        3. `GateRunner`:
           - Executes gates in deterministic phase order
           - Parallel execution within declared groups
           - Fail-fast policy per phase (configurable)
           - Typed `GateResult` with bounded logs + receipt hooks
           - Respects bounded containment controls (timeout, memory, pids)

        Gate IDs cover all former CI/lint script checks.

        Acceptance:
          - `GateRegistry` can enumerate all gates and resolve profiles.
          - `GateRunner` executes gates in phase order with parallel groups.
          - Fail-fast halts remaining gates in a phase on first failure.
          - Gate results are typed (not exit codes).

    - id: S2_PROFILE_CLI
      title: "Add --profile to apm2 fac gates as canonical CI entrypoint"
      detail: |
        Extend existing `apm2 fac gates` args:

            #[arg(long, default_value = "local-full")]
            pub profile: String,

        Profiles map to explicit gate lists:
          - `local-full`: all gates (lint, compile, test, doc, evidence, audit)
          - `quick`: fast-feedback subset (fmt, clippy, targeted tests)
          - `workflow-preflight`: GitHub Actions pre-merge checks
          - `drift-audit`: documentation/schema drift detection

        `apm2 fac gates --profile quick` replaces ad-hoc script
        combinations. `apm2 fac gates` (no args) defaults to
        `local-full`.

        Acceptance:
          - `apm2 fac gates --help` shows `--profile` with all options.
          - Each profile resolves to a deterministic gate list.
          - `apm2 fac gates --profile quick` runs only fast-feedback gates.

    - id: S3_FAC_REVIEW_INTEGRATION
      title: "Replace bash callsites in FAC review with gate-engine invocation"
      detail: |
        Three callsite migrations:

        1. `evidence.rs`: Replace shell script invocations with direct
           gate-engine calls. The gate engine returns typed results that
           feed directly into evidence attestation.

        2. `gate_attestation.rs`: Fingerprint Rust gate inputs (gate ID
           + version + config hash), not script paths. Attestation
           records become script-independent.

        3. `push.rs`: Update expected gate-set logic to use registry
           IDs (not file existence checks). Gate completeness is
           verified against the registry, not the filesystem.

        Acceptance:
          - Zero shell script execution from fac_review code paths.
          - Gate attestation fingerprints are deterministic and
            script-path-free.
          - push.rs gate-set validation uses registry gate IDs.

    - id: S4_WORKFLOW_MIGRATION
      title: "Rewrite GitHub Actions workflow to use apm2 fac gates --profile"
      detail: |
        Rewrite `.github/workflows/forge-admission-cycle.yml`:

        Replace all direct script execution with:

            apm2 fac gates --profile workflow-preflight

        The workflow becomes a thin shell around the gate engine.
        All gate logic lives in Rust, not in workflow YAML.

        Acceptance:
          - Workflow calls `apm2 fac gates --profile workflow-preflight`.
          - No direct script execution in workflow YAML.
          - CI pass/fail behavior is identical to pre-migration.

    - id: S5_NON_CI_SCRIPT_MIGRATION
      title: "Port non-CI scripts to dedicated command families"
      detail: |
        Three script families to migrate:

        1. Evidence scripts → `apm2 evidence verify` subcommands
           (JSON schema parity with original scripts).

        2. Skills sync → `apm2 dev skills-runtime-sync`
           (port skills/runtime synchronization logic).

        3. RFC loop → `apm2 factory rfc-codex-loop`
           (port RFC codex loop orchestration).

        Delete original scripts after parity tests pass.

        Acceptance:
          - `apm2 evidence verify` produces identical output to
            original evidence scripts.
          - `apm2 dev skills-runtime-sync` replaces skills sync script.
          - `apm2 factory rfc-codex-loop` replaces RFC loop script.
          - Original scripts deleted.

    - id: S6_REFERENCE_REWRITE
      title: "Rewrite all repository references from script paths to new commands"
      detail: |
        Sweep all docs, tickets, SKILL.md files, AGENTS.md files,
        workflow files, and code comments. Replace references to
        `scripts/*.sh` paths with the corresponding `apm2` command.

        Remove dead script-coupled code paths from Rust source.

        Acceptance:
          - `find . -type f -name '*.sh'` returns empty.
          - `rg -n 'scripts/.+\.sh|run_rfc_codex_loop\.sh'` returns empty.
          - `rg -n 'Command::new\("bash"|Command::new\("sh"'
            crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review` returns empty
            (non-test code).

    - id: S7_TESTING
      title: "Comprehensive test suite for gate engine, profiles, and migration"
      detail: |
        Unit tests:
          - One test module per migrated gate (fixtures as data files)
          - Parser/lint equivalence tests for rule-heavy checks
          - Profile composition tests (exact gate membership)

        Integration tests:
          - `apm2 fac gates --profile ...` pass/fail matrix
          - FAC review evidence integration (zero script execution)
          - Workflow-preflight gate tests with fixture event payloads
          - Evidence verify command tests (JSON schema parity)

        End-to-end:
          - Full `local-full` run on clean repo
          - Failure-injection suite for each guardrail gate
          - Command-output stability checks for machine consumers

        Hard compliance gates (must all pass):
          - `cargo fmt --all`
          - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
          - `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`
          - `cargo test --workspace`
          - `find . -type f -name '*.sh'` must be empty
          - `rg -n 'scripts/.+\.sh'` must be empty
          - `rg -n 'Command::new("bash")|Command::new("sh")'
            crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review` must be empty
            (non-test code)

        Acceptance:
          - All unit, integration, and e2e tests pass.
          - All hard compliance gates pass.

notes:
  context: |
    DESIGN: "CI = Gates" — single cutover to unified Rust gate engine.

    The core insight is that CI behavior should be defined exclusively
    by gate profiles under `apm2 fac gates`. Shell scripts are a
    historical artifact from before the Rust gate system existed. Now
    that the gate engine can handle all check types (lint, compile,
    test, doc, evidence, audit), there's no reason to maintain two
    orchestration models.

    The migration is a single PR with no transitional wrappers:
    1. Implement gate engine + profiles
    2. Switch fac gates and FAC review to engine
    3. Migrate workflow
    4. Port non-CI scripts to existing command families
    5. Rewrite all references
    6. Delete all .sh files + dead code
    7. Run full validation suite and merge

    Assumptions:
    - No compatibility wrappers for old script paths
    - CI is defined exclusively by gate profiles under apm2 fac gates
    - Historical docs are rewritten to eliminate script pointers

    This ticket was informed by a Codex investigation into gate
    throughput regression (TCK-00612) which revealed the dual
    shell/Rust execution model as a source of inconsistency and
    maintenance burden.
  security: "default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed"
