root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    Gate execution currently interleaves preparation (readiness checks,
    dependency resolution) with execution (running individual gates). This
    means a gate can fail mid-run due to an infrastructure problem that could
    have been detected and fixed before any gate started, producing ambiguous
    partial results and making failure attribution hard. The PREP/EXECUTE split
    makes the two concerns orthogonal and separately observable.

      title: "Define and implement the PREP phase"
      detail: |
        PREP phase steps (in order):
          1. ReadinessController::run() (TCK-00620)
          2. Dependency closure hydration check (TCK-00623, stub/no-op if not yet landed)
          3. Emit prep_started event on stdout (per REQ-0036 schema)
          4. For each prep step, emit prep_step event (step name, status, duration_ms)
          5. On any failure: emit structured failure (stage: "prep") and exit.
        PREP phase MUST complete before EXECUTE begins.
    - id: "S2_EXECUTE_PHASE"
      title: "Define and implement the EXECUTE phase"
      detail: |
        EXECUTE phase:
          - Runs gates in deterministic order (existing gate ordering preserved).
          - MUST NOT perform ambient filesystem mutations outside gate workspaces.
          - Emits execute_started event on stdout before first gate runs.
          - Each gate emits gate_started and gate_finished events.
          - Network denial enforced (TCK-00622 wires the enforcement;
            this ticket reserves the hook point).
    - id: "S3_SEPARATE_REPORTING"
      title: "Emit separately timed PREP and EXECUTE outcome events"
      detail: |
        run_summary event MUST include:
          - prep_duration_ms
          - execute_duration_ms
          - phase_failed: "prep" | "execute" | null
        run_failed event MUST include stage field.
    - id: "S4_REGRESSION_TESTS"
      title: "Regression tests for phase separation"
      detail: |
        - Test: PREP failure → zero gates run → run_failed has stage=prep.
        - Test: PREP success → EXECUTE runs → run_summary has both durations.
        - Test: EXECUTE failure → run_failed has stage=execute.
        - Test: EXECUTE makes no ambient mutations outside gate workspaces.

      title: "Implement PREP phase runner"
      detail: |
        Call ReadinessController::run(), emit prep events, fail fast on error.
        Stub closure hydration hook (no-op until TCK-00623 lands).
    - id: "STEP_03"
      title: "Implement EXECUTE phase runner"
      detail: |
        Wrap existing gate dispatch loop. Emit execute_started before first
        gate. Enforce no-ambient-mutation invariant by asserting workspace
        paths before and after (test hook only in EXECUTE phase).
    - id: "STEP_04"
      title: "Wire phase runner into fac gates entry point"
      detail: |
        Replace the current flat gate dispatch with run_gates_phased().
        Emit run_summary at end with both phase durations.

notes:
  context: |
    This ticket restructures the gates runner into two explicit phases. It
    depends on TCK-00620 (ReadinessController) but does not require TCK-00622
    or TCK-00623 to be complete — those integrate via stub hook points that
    this ticket reserves. The JSONL event schema is stubbed here and fully
    defined in TCK-00625.
  security: "fail-closed: PREP failure prevents any gate execution"
