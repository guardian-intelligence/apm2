  - step: 1
    action: Define EpisodeState enum
    details: 'Create state machine per AD-EPISODE-002:

      - CREATED: Envelope accepted, resources not allocated

      - RUNNING: Harness spawned, I/O streaming

      - TERMINATED: Normal completion, evidence finalized

    action: Implement state transitions
    details: 'Create transition methods with invariants:

      - create(): -> CREATED

      - start(): CREATED -> RUNNING (requires valid lease)

      - stop(): RUNNING -> TERMINATED

      - quarantine(): RUNNING -> QUARANTINED

      - No transitions from terminal states

      '
  - step: 3
    action: Implement EpisodeRuntime
    details: 'Create runtime struct with:

      - DashMap for concurrent episode tracking

      - Ledger/CAS/Policy references

      - AdapterRegistry for harness lookup

      - Methods: create, start, stop, signal, observe

  - step: 4
    action: Implement event emission
    details: 'Emit events for all transitions:

      - episode.created (envelope_hash)

      - episode.started (session_pid, io_stream_id)

    action: Create SessionHandle
    details: 'Create handle for running episode:

  summary: 'Implement EpisodeRuntime with state machine per AD-EPISODE-002.

    Manages episode lifecycle (create/start/stop/signal) with event emission

    for all state transitions. States: CREATED -> RUNNING -> TERMINATED | QUARANTINED.
