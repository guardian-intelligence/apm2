    RFC-0027 specifies Proof-Carrying Authority Continuity (PCAC): a canonical
    authority lifecycle contract for authority-bearing side effects:

      join -> revalidate -> consume -> effect

    This YAML decomposition is lossless-by-reference to the canonical Markdown
    specification and preserves all normative detail by explicit section binding.

    role: "Master normative specification"
    resolution_hint: "Repository-resolved file path: documents/rfcs/RFC-0027/PROOF_CARRYING_AUTHORITY_CONTINUITY.md"

  decomposition:
    - "00_meta.yaml: RFC metadata, dependencies, custody, and invariants"
    - "01_problem_and_imports.yaml: problem framing, imported constraints, objective contracts"
    - "02_design_decisions.yaml: core abstraction, semantic laws, evidence-level policy"
    - "03_trust_boundaries.yaml: lifecycle trust boundaries, replay/acceptance, threat model"
    - "04_contracts_and_versioning.yaml: type contracts, receipt auth shapes, compatibility rules"
    - "05_rollout_and_ops.yaml: rollout phases, policy surface, operational controls"
    - "06_ticket_decomposition.yaml: implementation tickets mapped to requirements/evidence"
    - "07_test_and_evidence.yaml: test matrix and evidence bundle definitions"
    - "08_risks_and_open_questions.yaml: risks, tradeoffs, unresolved decisions"
    - "09_governance_and_gates.yaml: gates, governance execution, waiver policy"
