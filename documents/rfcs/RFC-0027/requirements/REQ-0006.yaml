  title: "Replay-order and selector completeness for authoritative outcomes"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Authoritative replay/adjudication MUST validate lifecycle ordering and
    selector completeness:

      AuthorityJoin < AuthorityRevalidate < AuthorityConsume <= EffectReceipt

    When pre-actuation applies, `AuthorityConsume` MUST reference the prior
    pre-actuation selector.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0002, TCK-PCAC-0004.
  rationale: |
    Deterministic replay and authoritative acceptance require machine-checkable
    lifecycle sequencing, not inferred handler behavior.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Replay rejects authoritative outcomes with missing lifecycle selectors"
    - "Replay rejects authority lifecycle order violations"
    - "Pre-actuation-required classes fail when consume lacks prerequisite selector binding"
