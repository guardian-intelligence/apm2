  schema_version: "2026-02-07"
  id: "REQ-0005"
  title: "Intent digest equality at consume-time"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    `consume` MUST require exact `intent_digest` equality between the consumed
    certificate and the effect being authorized.

    Intent mismatch MUST deny authoritative admission.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0002.
  rationale: |
    Intent equality prevents authority reuse across different effects and is core
    to non-transferable authorization semantics.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Consume denies when request/effect intent digest differs from AJC intent digest"
    - "Effect receipts bind the same intent digest used by consume"
    - "No authoritative allow exists for intent-mismatch scenarios"
