  title: "Tier2+ sovereignty composition at revalidate and consume"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Tier2+ authority-bearing operations MUST compose with sovereignty constraints
    at revalidate and consume, including:

    - fresh sovereignty epoch evidence,
    - known principal revocation-head status,
    - autonomy ceiling compatibility,
    - no active sovereign freeze for target scope.

    Missing, stale, parse-invalid, signature-invalid, or unknown sovereignty
    inputs MUST deny consume and trigger configured freeze action where applicable.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0006.
  rationale: |
    Tier2+ authority continuity is incomplete unless consume-time admissibility is
    composed with sovereignty-state certainty.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier2+ consume denies on stale or unknown sovereignty epoch evidence"
    - "Tier2+ consume denies on unknown principal revocation-head state"
    - "Tier2+ consume denies when active freeze or incompatible autonomy ceiling applies"
