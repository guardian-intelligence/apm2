  title: "Delegation narrowing strict-subset enforcement"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Delegated authority joins MUST be strict-subset constrained relative to the
    parent authority scope. Any widening attempt MUST deny.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0003.
  rationale: |
    Strict narrowing is required to prevent confused-deputy and privilege
    escalation defects in delegated authority paths.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Delegation widening attempts are rejected"
    - "Delegation lineage bindings are present in delegated consume receipts"
    - "Privileged delegated handlers enforce strict-subset semantics"
