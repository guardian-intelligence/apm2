  schema_version: "2026-02-07"
  id: "REQ-0002"
  title: "Single-consume uniqueness for authority witnesses"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    For authoritative mode, each `ajc_id` MUST admit at most one successful
    authoritative consume operation.

    Duplicate consume attempts for the same `ajc_id` MUST deny.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0005.
  rationale: |
    Copyable certificate bytes are acceptable; duplicate authoritative effects are
    not. The security invariant is unique successful consume.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Second consume attempt against the same ajc_id is denied"
    - "Duplicate consume deny remains true under replay and restart tests"
    - "Authoritative consume count per ajc_id is never greater than one"
