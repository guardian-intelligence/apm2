  title: "PointerOnly waiver-binding and expiry behavior"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Any `PointerOnly` identity-evidence admission MUST be explicitly waiver-bound,
    machine-readable, risk-tier scoped, and expiry-enforced.

    On waiver expiry or invalidity, admission MUST revert immediately to
    fail-closed behavior.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0007.
  rationale: |
    Transitional allowances are acceptable only when they are explicit, bounded,
    and observable; implicit drift is non-admissible.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "PointerOnly admissions emit waiver-binding lifecycle receipts"
    - "Tier2+ defaults deny PointerOnly absent explicit waiver"
    - "Waiver expiry immediately causes deny outcomes for PointerOnly paths"
