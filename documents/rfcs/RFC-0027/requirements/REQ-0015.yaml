  title: "Objective contract evidence export"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    RFC-0027 objective contracts (OBJ-PCAC-01..06) MUST be exported as
    machine-readable summaries at the declared evidence paths so predicates can
    be evaluated without prose interpretation.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0009.
  rationale: |
    Objective governance becomes auditable only when outputs are machine-checkable
    and reproducibly generated.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Each objective path publishes a summary.json with required predicate fields"
    - "Objective machine predicates evaluate deterministically"
    - "Unknown-state accounting fields are present and enforced fail-closed"
  evidence_ids:
    - "EVID-0009"
  source_refs:
    - "PROOF_CARRYING_AUTHORITY_CONTINUITY.md §0.3"
    - "PROOF_CARRYING_AUTHORITY_CONTINUITY.md §15.1"
    - "09_governance_and_gates.yaml"
