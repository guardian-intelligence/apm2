  title: "Privileged handler lifecycle integration"
  category: "INTEROPERABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Privileged authority-bearing handlers (`DelegateSublease`,
    `IngestReviewReceipt`) MUST adopt PCAC lifecycle enforcement with policy-gated
    rollout and without protocol wire break.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0003, TCK-PCAC-0007.
  rationale: |
    Leaving privileged paths outside PCAC introduces policy and verification
    asymmetry that undermines containment.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "DelegateSublease path emits join/consume lifecycle receipts"
    - "IngestReviewReceipt path emits join/consume lifecycle receipts"
    - "Policy flag can switch privileged endpoints to lifecycle enforcement without wire break"
