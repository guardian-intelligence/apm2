  title: "Revocation frontier dominance at revalidate and consume"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Revalidate and consume MUST deny when revocation state has advanced beyond
    certificate admissibility.

    Revocation-head commitment fields and current revocation inputs MUST be
    included in authority decisions.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0001.
  rationale: |
    Join-time admissibility cannot be assumed durable under evolving revocation
    state; consume-time enforcement is required.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Revalidate denies when revocation head advancement invalidates AJC"
    - "Consume denies when current revocation head conflicts with certificate admissibility"
    - "Revocation-head commitments are present in certificate and receipts where required"
