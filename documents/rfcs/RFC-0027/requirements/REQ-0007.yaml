  title: "Authoritative receipt acceptance-fact binding completeness"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    For authoritative acceptance, lifecycle receipts MUST bind all mandatory
    acceptance-fact fields, including envelope/view/time commitments and an
    admissible receipt-authentication shape:

    - direct: `authority_seal_hash`, or
    - pointer/batched: `receipt_hash` + `authority_seal_hash` + inclusion proof
      and batch-root bindings as required by receipt shape.

    Missing required authoritative bindings MUST fail closed.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0001, TCK-PCAC-0004.
  rationale: |
    Receipt existence alone is insufficient. Acceptance facts must be
    cryptographically admissible across replay and adjudication contexts.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Authoritative receipts include episode_envelope_hash and view_commitment_hash"
    - "Only admissible direct or pointer authentication shapes are accepted"
    - "Forwarded raw event bytes without admissible receipt-auth shape are non-authoritative"
