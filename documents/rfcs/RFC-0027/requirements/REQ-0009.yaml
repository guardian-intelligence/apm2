  schema_version: "2026-02-07"
  id: "REQ-0009"
  title: "Pre-actuation prerequisite binding before consume"
  category: "INTEROPERABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    When policy requires pre-actuation checks for an effect class, consume MUST
    require and reference the bound pre-actuation receipt selector(s).

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0002.
  rationale: |
    Pre-actuation checks are only authoritative when causally and cryptographically
    bound to consume and effect admission.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Pre-actuation-required classes deny when prerequisite receipt bindings are missing"
    - "Consume receipts include selectors for required pre-actuation checks"
    - "Replay order verifies AuthorityJoin < PreActuationCheck < AuthorityRevalidate < AuthorityConsume <= EffectReceipt"
