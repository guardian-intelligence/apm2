  title: "Mandatory PCAC lifecycle for authority-bearing side effects"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Any authority-bearing side effect MUST be admitted only through a successful
    PCAC lifecycle: `join -> revalidate -> consume -> effect`.

    Authoritative execution MUST fail closed when any lifecycle stage is missing,
    invalid, or non-authoritative.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0001, TCK-PCAC-0002.
  rationale: |
    Endpoint-local guard composition alone is not a stable abstraction for
    authority continuity. A single lifecycle contract prevents path-level drift.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "RequestTool authoritative side effects do not execute without successful join/revalidate/consume"
    - "Lifecycle stage omission deterministically denies authoritative acceptance"
    - "Lifecycle receipts exist and bind to the executed effect selector"
