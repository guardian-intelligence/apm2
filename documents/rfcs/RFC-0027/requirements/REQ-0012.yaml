  title: "Containment-safe PCAC policy surface"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Runtime policy MUST expose the minimum PCAC control knobs defined by RFC-0027,
    including lifecycle requirements, tiered identity/freshness constraints,
    sovereignty composition toggles, and containment-safe defaults.

    Unknown or indeterminate policy states in authority-critical paths MUST deny.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0007.
  rationale: |
    PCAC needs explicit policy controls to avoid implicit behavior drift across
    tiers and handlers.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All minimum policy knobs in RFC-0027 section 9 are represented and enforceable"
    - "Containment-safe defaults are active when policy data is missing or unknown"
    - "Tier2+ policy controls can enforce verified identity and sovereignty checks"
