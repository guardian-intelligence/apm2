  title: "Durable consume record barrier before authoritative effect"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Authoritative consume acceptance MUST require a durable consume record that
    is committed before effect acceptance.

    In-memory uniqueness without crash-safe durability is non-admissible for
    authoritative mode.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0005, TCK-PCAC-0010.
  rationale: |
    Single-consume semantics are not containment-grade unless uniqueness survives
    crash/restart and replay conditions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Consume record durability barrier is enforced before authoritative effect acceptance"
    - "Crash-replay cannot admit authoritative effects with missing durable consume record"
    - "Durable consume record coverage metric is 1.0 for authoritative consumes"
