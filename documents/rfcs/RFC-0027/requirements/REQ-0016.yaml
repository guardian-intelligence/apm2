  id: "REQ-0016"
  title: "Gate registry predicate evidence export"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Gate registry entries (GATE-PCAC-LIFECYCLE, GATE-PCAC-SINGLE-CONSUME,
    GATE-PCAC-FRESHNESS, GATE-PCAC-REPLAY) MUST have machine-evaluable evidence
    summaries at declared gate evidence paths.

    Missing, invalid, stale, or indeterminate gate evidence MUST fail closed.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0009, TCK-PCAC-0010.
  rationale: |
    Gate execution cannot be delegated to prose interpretation for containment-
    critical controls.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Gate summary artifacts exist for all PCAC gates"
    - "Gate predicates evaluate deterministically against summary artifacts"
    - "Missing/indeterminate predicate fields produce deny outcomes"
  evidence_ids:
    - "EVID-0009"
    - "EVID-0010"
