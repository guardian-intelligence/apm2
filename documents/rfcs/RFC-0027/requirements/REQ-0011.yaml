  title: "Verifier-economics bounds and fail-closed enforcement"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    PCAC verification MUST enforce declared verifier-economics constraints for
    each deployment profile, including bounded p95 join/revalidate/consume and
    anti-entropy operations.

    Tier2+ authority admission MUST fail closed when declared bounds are exceeded
    and no admissible degraded-mode policy exists.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0008.
  rationale: |
    Security posture that cannot remain bounded under adversarial load is not
    operationally admissible.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Profile declares p95 bounds for join/revalidate/consume/anti-entropy"
    - "Tier2+ verification tracks proof-check counts and bound adherence"
    - "Bound exceedance without explicit degraded-mode policy path denies authority admission"
