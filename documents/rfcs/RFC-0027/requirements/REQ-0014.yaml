  schema_version: "2026-02-07"
  id: "REQ-0014"
  title: "Normative falsification-suite conformance"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Conformance testing MUST include explicit falsification probes for the
    normative Section 16 criteria.

    Any falsification criterion hit in authoritative mode MUST fail the relevant
    gate as defined by governance policy.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-PCAC-0010.
  rationale: |
    A security abstraction is only defensible if failure cases are explicitly
    testable and gate-enforced.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Test suite exercises all Section 16 falsification scenarios"
    - "Detected falsification outcomes are machine-visible in evidence artifacts"
    - "Gate logic treats falsification hits as non-admissible"
