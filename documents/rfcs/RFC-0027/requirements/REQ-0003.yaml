  title: "Tier2+ freshness deny on stale or ambiguous authority"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Tier2+ authority paths MUST deny consume when freshness authority input is
    stale, missing, unknown, or ambiguous.

    Freshness uncertainty in authority-critical paths is fail-closed.

    Primary delivery tickets: TCK-PCAC-0006, TCK-PCAC-0010.
  rationale: |
    High-tier authority cannot rely on permissive freshness semantics without
    opening replay and stale-authority acceptance risks.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier2+ stale freshness input results in deny"
    - "Tier2+ ambiguous freshness state results in deny"
    - "No Tier2+ allow outcomes exist for stale/unknown freshness inputs"
