      Endpoint-local guard hardening does not provide a single composable authority
      object proving admissibility at a specific time/revocation/freshness state and
      consume uniqueness boundary.

      PCAC addresses this by defining a canonical authority lifecycle with fail-closed
      semantics and replay-verifiable receipts:

        join -> revalidate -> consume -> effect
    out_of_scope_confirmations:
      - "Replacing FAC governance model"
      - "Weakening containment precedence for liveness"
      - "Allowing authoritative acceptance without replay-resolvable receipts"
