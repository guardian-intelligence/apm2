    - id: "DEC-0001"
      title: "Adopt PCAC lifecycle as normative primitive"
      statement: "Use join/revalidate/consume/effect as the sole admissibility contract for authority-bearing side effects."

    - id: "DEC-0002"
      title: "Use copy-tolerant certificate semantics with durable single-consume enforcement"
      statement: "Certificate bytes may be copied; authoritative consume uniqueness must remain durable."

    - id: "DEC-0003"
      title: "Bind authoritative receipts to HSI acceptance-fact surfaces"
      statement: "Authoritative acceptance requires envelope/view/time bindings and seal/pointer proof shapes per RFC-0020 composition."

    - id: "DEC-0004"
      title: "Normalize time and revocation vocabulary to HTF/PSI contracts"
      statement: "Use `time_envelope_ref`, tick-space expiration, ledger anchor, and revocation head commitments as normative time/revocation fields."

    - id: "DEC-0005"
      title: "Compose Tier2+ consume with sovereignty constraints"
      statement: "Tier2+ consume requires fresh sovereignty epoch evidence, known principal revocation head, autonomy ceiling compatibility, and no active sovereign freeze."
