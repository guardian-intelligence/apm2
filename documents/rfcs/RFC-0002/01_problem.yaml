      This RFC addresses the migration of 5 development scripts in `scripts/dev/` to a
      typesafe Rust xtask crate. This is a standalone RFC with no PRD binding.

      ## Current State

      The following bash scripts exist in `scripts/dev/`:
      - `start-eng-ticket.sh` - Creates worktree for a ticket from an RFC
      - `commit-eng-ticket.sh` - Runs fmt/clippy/test and creates commit
      - `push-eng-ticket.sh` - Pushes branch, creates PR, requests AI reviews
      - `check-eng-ticket.sh` - Shows ticket status, PR checks, review status
      - `finish-eng-ticket.sh` - Cleans up worktree after PR merge

      ## Problems with Current Approach

      1. **Not typesafe**: Silent failures, unquoted variables, string parsing errors
      2. **Not cross-platform**: Bash-specific syntax, GNU tool dependencies
      3. **Duplicate code**: Common patterns repeated across scripts (branch validation,
         git operations, YAML parsing)
      4. **Hard to test**: No unit testing capability for shell scripts
      5. **Inconsistent error handling**: Some scripts fail silently, others exit on error
      6. **Complex string manipulation**: Regex patterns embedded in bash are fragile

      ## Goals

      Migrate all scripts to the xtask pattern following the standards in
      `documents/skills/xtask-scripting/SKILL.md`:
      - Typesafe command execution with xshell
      - Shared utilities for common operations
      - Proper error handling with context
      - Cross-platform compatibility
      - Testable code structure
    out_of_scope_confirmations:
    - "CI/CD pipeline changes - scripts will remain invocable via cargo xtask"
    - "New features - this is a 1:1 migration of existing functionality"
    - "Workflow changes - command names map directly to old script names"

      rationale: |
        This RFC is a standalone tooling migration with no external PRD requirements.
        All requirements are implicit: maintain feature parity with existing scripts.
      evidence_policy: "Evidence is the passing of integration tests that verify feature parity."
