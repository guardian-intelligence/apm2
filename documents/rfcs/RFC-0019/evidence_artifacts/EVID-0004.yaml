  status: "PENDING"
  description: |
    Evidence that tool execution produces CAS-addressed results and surfaces `result_hash`
    through the tool execution stack and lifecycle signals.

    Minimum proof points:
    - ToolExecutor stores ToolResultData in CAS and returns/surfaces `result_hash`
    - Tool lifecycle event/response includes `result_hash`
    - All surfaced result hashes resolve in CAS
