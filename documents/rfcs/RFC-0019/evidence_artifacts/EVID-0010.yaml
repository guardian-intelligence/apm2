  description: |
    Evidence that tool actuation evidence is scalable and replayable:
    - ToolResultData hashes are stored in CAS per tool call and propagated (REQ-0004)
    - ToolExecutionReceipt is emitted per tool actuation, signed, stored in CAS, and binds args/result hashes
    - ToolLogIndexV1 references ToolExecutionReceipt hashes with canonical ordering/chunking (single-pointer audit index)
    - SummaryReceipt is produced with loss profile + selectors for zoom-in
