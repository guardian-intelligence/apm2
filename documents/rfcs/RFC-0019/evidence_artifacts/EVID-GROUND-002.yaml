  title: "Grounding: Tool result hashing and ToolLogIndex gap"
  category: "DESIGN_REVIEWS"
  status: "APPROVED"
  description: |
    Codebase grounding confirming ToolResultData is already stored in CAS but the
    resulting hash is not propagated through ToolResult/receipt structures, and
    that ToolExecutionReceipt + ToolLogIndex are net-new artifact types needed for
    proof-carrying tool use and audit ergonomics.
