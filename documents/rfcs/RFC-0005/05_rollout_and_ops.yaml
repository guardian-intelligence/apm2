  template_version: "2026-01-24"

  rollout_plan:
    strategy: "Direct merge to main"
    rationale: |
      These are bug fixes for internal developer tooling. No phased rollout
      required. All developers benefit immediately from fixes. The --skip-checks
      flag provides an escape hatch for the commit command enhancement.

    phases:
      - phase: 1
        name: "Implement and merge bug fixes"
        description: |
          All 4 tickets can be implemented in parallel and merged independently.
          Each fix is isolated to a single file with no cross-dependencies.
        duration: "Can be completed in parallel"
        success_criteria:
          - "All tests pass"
          - "Manual verification of each fixed command"

      - phase: 2
        name: "End-to-end workflow verification"
        description: |
          After all fixes merged, run through complete dev-eng-ticket workflow
          to verify everything works together.
        duration: "Single workflow run"
        success_criteria:
          - "`cargo xtask check` correctly detects CI status"
          - "`cargo xtask push` creates visible status checks"
          - "`cargo xtask review quality` runs without argument errors"
          - "`cargo xtask commit` runs local checks successfully"

  operational_considerations:
    monitoring:
      - "Developers will notice improved behavior immediately"
      - "CI logs will show correct status reporting"

    rollback:
      strategy: "git revert if issues discovered"
      notes: "Each fix is a single commit, easy to revert independently"

    dependencies:
      - name: "gh CLI"
        version: "2.x"
        notes: "Must be installed and authenticated"
      - name: "codex CLI"
        version: "current"
        notes: "Required for review quality command"
      - name: "cargo-semver-checks"
        version: "any"
        notes: "Optional; commit command warns if not installed"
