      This RFC defines the holonic coordination framework that enables autonomous
      agents to operate within bounded authority. Building on RFC-0001's kernel
      infrastructure, this RFC provides:

      1. **Holon Trait**: The contract surface (Markov blanket) for agent participation.
         Defines intake, execution, artifact emission, and escalation patterns.

      2. **WorkObject Lifecycle**: Durable work contracts with state machine tracking
         from creation through completion or escalation.

      3. **Lease & Budget**: Resource authority boundaries with explicit scope,
         expiration, and budget tracking across multiple dimensions.

      4. **Episode Execution**: Bounded agent execution with explicit stop conditions,
         context management, and result handling.

      5. **Skill Integration**: Extension of skill frontmatter to declare holonic
         behavior for skills that operate as bounded agents.

      The framework embodies the Principia Holonica axioms: Markov Blanket (I),
      Recursive Composability (II), and Bounded Authority (III).

        RFC-only requirements define holonic-specific contracts not covered by
        PRD requirements: Holon trait definition, episode execution patterns,
        work lifecycle states, and lease derivation rules.
