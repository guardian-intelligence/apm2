  statement: |
    Pulse payloads must not include file paths, tool arguments, diffs, or
    secrets. Only opaque IDs, hashes, and bounded metadata are permitted. Pulses
    do not grant CAS read access; CAS reads require explicit hash allowlists in
    capability manifests/leases.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No human-readable note field exists in Phase 1."
    - "CAS access remains policy-gated; pulses carry hashes only."
    - "CAS reads for FAC artifacts require explicit hash allowlists."
