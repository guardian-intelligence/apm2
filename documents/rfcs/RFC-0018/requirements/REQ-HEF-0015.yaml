  title: "HTF envelope and ClockProfile enforcement on authoritative transitions"
  statement: |
    Authoritative FAC lifecycle transitions MUST bind time_envelope_ref that
    resolves to CAS-hosted TimeEnvelopeV1 with pinned clock_profile_hash.
    Transition validators MUST enforce profile admissibility by risk tier.

    Lease/gate/timeout/retry authority uses tick semantics and envelope
    containment checks; wall time remains observational only.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Transitions are denied if time_envelope_ref is missing, unresolvable, or references a disallowed clock_profile_hash."
    - "Lease/gate expiry decisions are tick/envelope-based and invariant under wall-time perturbation."
    - "No authoritative admission or gate decision consumes wall-time values directly."

    notes:
