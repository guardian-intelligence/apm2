  title: "ReviewBlocked liveness semantics"
  statement: |
    ReviewBlocked must be a ledger-anchored outcome with explicit reason codes
    (including apply/tool failures, policy/context denials, BINARY_UNSUPPORTED,
    MISSING_ARTIFACT, INVALID_BUNDLE, TIMEOUT) and CAS logs. Retries are
    bounded by HTF windows; blocked outcomes are durable receipts for liveness
    failures.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "ReviewBlockedRecorded is emitted for apply/tool failures with reason_code and CAS log hash."
    - "Invalid bundles or missing artifacts emit ReviewBlockedRecorded with reason_code=INVALID_BUNDLE or MISSING_ARTIFACT and CAS log hash."
    - "Retries are bounded by MonotonicTicks windows; blocked outcomes persist in ledger."
