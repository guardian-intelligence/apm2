  title: "TCK alias observation window with non-authoritative semantics"
  statement: |
    `TCK-*` identifiers may be retained as operator-facing aliases during a
    bounded observation window, but they are never authoritative runtime state.
    Runtime authority remains ledger/CAS work_id-centric.

    Observation exit decisions MUST use ledger windows and HTF tick spans, not
    wall-clock alone. Snapshot emitters are removed after exit criteria pass.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No runtime lifecycle decision uses ticket_alias or filesystem ticket state as authority."
    - "Reconciliation checks detect alias/work_id projection mismatches and gate promotion on zero unresolved mismatches."
    - "Observation-window sunset removes snapshot emitters while preserving historical alias trace fields."
