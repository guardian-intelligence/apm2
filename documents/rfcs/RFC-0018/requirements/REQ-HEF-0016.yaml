  title: "Staged xtask authority demotion with instruction-plane lockstep"
  statement: |
    xtask authority reduction for FAC lifecycle control MUST follow staged
    demotion semantics:

    Stage 1: explicit write controls + durable projection receipts.
    Stage 2: default path is projection-request/receipt mode (no direct writes by default).
    Stage 3: direct write path removed or restricted to local/dev breakglass.

    RoleSpecs and executable skills/prompts MUST be cut over in lockstep with
    runtime defaults to avoid split-brain operator instructions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Direct write paths require explicit override in Stage 1 and always emit durable receipts."
    - "Stage 2 default behavior has no direct write side-effects in lifecycle control paths."
    - "CI lint fails if deprecated lifecycle write commands or cargo xtask lifecycle control strings reappear in instruction assets."
