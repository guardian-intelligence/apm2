  statement: |
    Pulse emission must occur only after CAS persist and ledger commit. Ordering
    is authoritative by ledger cursor; expiry/backoff windows use MonotonicTicks;
    HLC is advisory only.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "CAS -> ledger -> pulse ordering enforced under failure injection."
    - "Pulse TTL/backoff uses MonotonicTicks; wall time is observational only."
