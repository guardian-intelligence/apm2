  title: "Digest-first scale surfaces and evidence economics"
  statement: |
    FAC cutover interfaces MUST remain digest-first and bounded under large
    evidence volumes. Supervisory surfaces consume summary receipts + selectors,
    and zoom into raw evidence by hash on demand.

    Projection and monitoring control planes must avoid transcript fan-out and
    preserve replay-safe side-effect semantics under retry/restart and partial
    loss conditions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Status/reporting APIs can operate from summary receipts and selector references without raw log transfer."
    - "Control-plane payload/queue growth remains bounded by configured budgets with explicit backpressure/drop accounting."
    - "Replay and anti-entropy drills recover projection state from ledger+CAS without duplicate side-effects."

    notes:
      - "Scale target assumes globally distributed high-volume evidence envelopes."
