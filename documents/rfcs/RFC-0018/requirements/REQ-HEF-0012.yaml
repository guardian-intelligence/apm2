  title: "WorkObject ledger authority and filesystem ticket exit"
  statement: |
    Runtime work lifecycle authority (claimability, ordering, transitions,
    completion eligibility) MUST be derived exclusively from ledger+CAS backed
    projections. Filesystem ticket YAML may exist for human traceability but is
    non-authoritative and must never drive runtime scheduling decisions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No runtime claim/transition path reads documents/work/tickets for authority decisions."
    - "Work graph and work object projections rebuild deterministically from ledger events and CAS artifacts alone."
    - "ClaimWork/ClaimNextWork/WorkStatus surfaces read projection state only, with no ambient filesystem truth."

    notes:
      - "Cutover is complete only when ticket-YAML authority reads are zero in production paths."
