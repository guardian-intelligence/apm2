  title: "FAC v0 diff observability via ChangeSetBundle"
  statement: |
    Reviewers must obtain the canonical diff from an internal ChangeSetBundleV1
    stored in CAS and bound to changeset_digest in the ledger. GitHub reads are
    never used for truth.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "ChangeSetBundleV1 is CAS-hosted and referenced by a ledger event (ChangeSetPublished)."
    - "Reviewers render diff/context from CAS without GitHub reads."
