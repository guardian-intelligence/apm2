  title: "Lifecycle transition authority bindings are mandatory"
  statement: |
    Authoritative lifecycle transitions MUST carry explicit delegated authority
    and boundary bindings. At minimum: lease_id, permeability_receipt_hash,
    capability_manifest_hash, context_pack_hash, stop_condition_hash, typed
    budgets, and policy_resolved_ref. Review/projection outcomes MUST bind
    view_commitment_hash, tool_log_index_hash, and summary_receipt_hash.

    Missing, unresolved, or mismatched bindings are hard failures with defect
    emission. Best-effort transition success is forbidden.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Transitions into CLAIMED/IN_PROGRESS/REVIEW/COMPLETED are rejected when required authority bindings are missing."
    - "Review and projection receipts include view commitment and evidence-index bindings sufficient for replay without ambient state."
    - "All required hashes are CAS-resolvable at validation time (not deferred)."
  evidence:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-HEF-0014"
    inherited_from_prd: false
    notes:
      - "Aligns with FAC boundary contracts and permeability discipline."
