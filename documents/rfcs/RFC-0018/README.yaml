  status: "DRAFT"

  note: |
    RFC-0018 defines a non-authoritative Pulse Plane for FAC. Pulses are lossy
    hints derived strictly from committed ledger+CAS artifacts and are never
    admissive or authoritative. Consumers must reconcile via ledger cursor
    catch-up. Phase 1 is local-only and brokerless.
