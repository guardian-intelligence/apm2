      HEF Phase 1 is a latency/UX accelerant layered on FAC; it does not alter
      admission authority. Pulses are derived only after ledger commit and never
      replace ledger/CAS verification.

      Independent assessment (current maturity evidence):
      - Ledger provides append-only storage with cursor-based reads and a head
        pointer (crates/apm2-core/src/ledger/storage.rs:303-307,412-518,719-736).
      - Kernel event schema defines WorkEvent, ToolEvent, SessionEvent,
        GateReceipt, and PolicyResolvedForChangeSet payloads
        (proto/kernel_events.proto:96-239,243-282,723-791).
      - ProtocolServer uses length-prefixed binary framing (max frame size
        16 MiB) with dual sockets (operator.sock/session.sock) and privilege
        separation (crates/apm2-daemon/src/protocol/mod.rs:38-48,
        crates/apm2-daemon/AGENTS.md:123-139,
        crates/apm2-daemon/src/protocol/dispatch.rs:724-783).
      - Legacy JSON IPC is forbidden in default builds (DD-009 hard cutover)
        (documents/rfcs/RFC-0017/02_design_decisions.yaml:632-649,
        crates/apm2-core/src/ipc/AGENTS.md:5-23).
      - Daemon ledger event emission for work claims is stubbed in-memory
        (StubLedgerEventEmitter) and not a persisted outbox
        (crates/apm2-daemon/src/protocol/dispatch.rs:148-169).
      - Runtime IPC defines EpisodeCreated/Started/Stopped but these are IPC
        messages, not ledger events (proto/apm2d_runtime_v1.proto:29-55).
      - GitHub projection is write-only; ledger remains the source of truth
        (crates/apm2-daemon/src/projection/mod.rs:4-21).
      - xtask commands directly write GitHub status checks via gh api, which is a
        bypass surface that HEF must not treat as authoritative
        (xtask/src/tasks/aat.rs:172-207, xtask/src/tasks/push.rs:239-365,
        xtask/src/tasks/review.rs:351-369).

      Dependencies:
      - RFC-0017 DD-009 hard cutover (ProtocolServer-only control plane) is a
        prerequisite for HEF enforcement on operator/session sockets
        (documents/rfcs/RFC-0017/02_design_decisions.yaml:632-649).
      - HEF depends on FAC receipts and evidence invariants defined in
        RFC-0015 and PRD-0009 (no new admission authority is introduced).
    out_of_scope_confirmations:
      - "No message broker, durable pubsub, or multi-host discovery (Phase 1)."
      - "No authoritative admission decisions or gate outcomes from pulses."
      - "No new truth-plane in addition to ledger+CAS."

      rationale: |
        HEF Phase 1 introduces pulse-plane contracts, ACLs, resource governance,
        and disclosure rules that are not explicit PRD requirements and must be
        specified at RFC granularity.
      evidence_policy: "RFC-only requirements MUST define new evidence artifacts in 07_test_and_evidence.yaml or in rfc/evidence_artifacts/."
