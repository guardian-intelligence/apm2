  title: "CI Readiness Transition Evidence Backing Tests"
  description: |
    Tests verifying READY_FOR_REVIEW transition requires evidence-backed CI import.
    Transitions must not be based only on 'success' conclusion. EvidencePublished
    entries must exist for CI logs/artifacts and be referenced from transition
    rationale metadata.
