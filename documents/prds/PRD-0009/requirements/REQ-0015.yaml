  title: "AAT quorum/audit enforcement by risk tier"
  statement: |
    For risk_tier=HIGH, admission MUST require two independent AAT receipts from
    disjoint runner pools. For risk_tier=MED, admission MUST require audit re-run
    at a target rate before finalization. For LOW, no quorum is required.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "HIGH tier requires two receipts signed by distinct runner pool roots. Verified by: Quorum validation test."
    - "MED tier audit re-run occurs at target rate and must PASS before admission finalizes. Verified by: Audit gating test."
    - "LOW tier does not require quorum but still enforces evidence bindings. Verified by: Policy test."
