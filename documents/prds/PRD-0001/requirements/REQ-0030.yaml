  type: OPERABILITY
  title: Operational packaging and deployment
  statement: 'The system MUST be operable as a single pinned binary with deterministic
    configuration: it supports system service managers, environment isolation, and
    secure defaults across Linux and macOS node classes.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - A release build produces a single binary and publishes a checksum and signature.
  - System service templates exist for systemd (Linux) and launchd (macOS).
  - Configuration is loaded from a deterministic path, validated, hashed, and recorded
    in the ledger.
  - Default configuration is secure (network denied, minimal tools enabled) and must
    be explicitly relaxed.
  - Node startup performs self-checks and fails closed if required dependencies are
    missing.
