  title: Offline-first operation with default network denial
  statement: Nodes MUST support operation without external network access by default,
    including local inference workflows; any network access MUST be explicitly enabled
    by policy and recorded as an audited exception.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - With network disabled, core workflows (PRD/RFC/ticket creation, local tests, local
    inference) can execute to completion where inputs are present.
  - Verification commands for required evidence artifacts declare network_access and
    are DISALLOWED unless explicitly allow-listed.
  - Network-denied policy is enforced at the syscall layer and, where available, at
    the OS sandbox boundary.
  - When disconnected from parents/peers, nodes continue with already-held authority
    and local policy; new authority cannot be minted without the configured issuer.
  - All network policy decisions are audit logged with rule IDs and rationale codes.
