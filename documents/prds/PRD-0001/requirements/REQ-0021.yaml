  title: Holonic scaling and bounded fanout
  statement: 'The system MUST scale holonically: each node can supervise workers and
    child nodes; fanout and message rates must be bounded to prevent N^2 explosions;
    rate limits are enforced mechanically.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - A node maintains at most one parent link and a bounded number of children per
    configured limit.
  - Group fanout uses bounded membership lists; store-and-forward is profile controlled.
  - Per-actor and per-work message rates are limited; violations trigger throttling
    or quarantine.
  - Replication uses cursors and segments to bound memory and bandwidth usage.
  - A single large host can simulate a multi-node holarchy with deterministic behaviors
    for testing.
