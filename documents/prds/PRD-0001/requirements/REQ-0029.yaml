  title: Schema and protocol evolution policy
  statement: 'Schema and protocol evolution MUST be managed explicitly: versioning
    schemes are declared, backward-incompatible changes require explicit version bumps
    and migration plans, and compatibility tests are mandatory.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Every schema and profile includes a version and a declared versioning scheme.
  - Backward-incompatible changes include a migration plan and are gated by authority
    signoff.
  - Upcasters are provided for supported prior versions where feasible.
  - Changelogs enumerate breaking and non-breaking changes for each release.
  - Compatibility tests run in CI and are captured as evidence.
