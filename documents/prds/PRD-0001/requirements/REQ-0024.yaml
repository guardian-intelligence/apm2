  title: Executable runbooks and operator interface
  statement: The system MUST include machine-executable runbooks and an operator interface
    (CLI) that can run workflows, inspect projections, and trigger remediation with
    deterministic outputs suitable for autonomous operation and auditing.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Runbooks are executable scripts or subcommands with deterministic outputs and
    declared network_access.
  - CLI can inspect active leases, session health, policy posture, and evidence indices
    without manual database access.
  - Operator actions are logged as events with identity and policy checks.
  - Help text and errors are agent-friendly and reference next steps deterministically.
  - Documentation includes versioned contract descriptions for kernel and HWP layers.
