  type: INTEROPERABILITY
  title: Multi-language compatibility surface
  statement: The system MUST define a stable, versioned wire schema and compatibility
    window that enables nodes implemented in other languages to interoperate for federation
    and evidence exchange, subject to identical security verification rules.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Wire schemas are published with schema_id and versioning scheme.
  - Compatibility tests validate encoding/decoding across at least one non-Rust implementation
    within the version window.
  - Unknown fields are handled per specification (reject or ignore) deterministically
    for signed records.
  - A node can reject peers outside the supported compatibility window with a deterministic
    reason code.
  - Protocol profiles are explicitly negotiated during handshake.
  evidence:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0007
    - EVID-0008
