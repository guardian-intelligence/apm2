  title: Automated Gate Receipts and Evidence Profiles
  statement: 'The system MUST support automated generation of "Gate Receipts" and
    provide evidence profiles (e.g., DEV_FAST, HIGH_ASSURANCE) to balance throughput
    and assurance levels.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Harness auto-generates Gate Receipts containing commit SHA, files changed, and
    artifact refs for test/lint outputs.
  - Gate Receipts follow a minimal schema (PASS/FAIL, reason_codes, artifact_refs)
    to minimize token usage and enable autonomous decisioning.
  - Profiles correctly toggle evidence depth requirements (e.g., DEV_FAST omits threat
    review artifacts).
  - The completion reducer accepts auto-generated receipts as valid evidence of gate
    passage.
