  title: Lease Registrar and Authority-of-Issuance
  statement: 'The system MUST designate a single Lease Registrar for each work scope
    (typically the parent holon); only events signed by the authoritative registrar
    key are valid for lease issuance or transfer.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Every work scope has a designated registrar assigned via a REGISTRAR.ASSIGNED event.
  - LEASE.ISSUED events MUST carry a valid cryptographic signature from the designated
    registrar.
  - Children holons may continue executing under already-held leases while partitioned
    but are forbidden from minting new leases or transferring authority offline.
  - The system rejects any lease event not signed by the authoritative registrar for
    the current work scope.
