  title: Agent-friendly and accessible interfaces
  statement: 'All user-visible outputs (CLI, logs, evidence summaries) MUST be agent-friendly:
    structured, non-ambiguous, and accessible in terminal contexts; outputs must support
    low-context agents by linking explicit refs rather than embedding large dumps.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - CLI outputs provide stable machine-readable modes (e.g., JSON) in addition to
    human-readable text.
  - All references are explicit path#root_key refs or content hashes; no implicit
    cross-file references.
  - Error and status outputs avoid prose-only descriptions; they include codes and
    next actions.
  - Terminal output avoids reliance on color-only cues; critical information is conveyed
    textually.
  - A low-context agent can complete a ticket using only the ticket file, referenced
    requirements, and referenced standards.
