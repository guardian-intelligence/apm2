  requirements:
  - id: EPOL-0001
    statement: Every PRD requirement MUST map to one or more evidence artifacts with
      reproducible verification commands.
  - id: EPOL-0002
    statement: Evidence artifacts MUST declare data classification and redaction guidance;
      RESTRICTED evidence MUST set redaction.required=true and include redaction steps.
  - id: EPOL-0003
    statement: Evidence capture paths MUST be deterministic and relative to the evidence
      bundle root; artifacts are content-addressed where feasible.
  - id: EPOL-0004
    statement: All evidence verification commands MUST declare network_access; default
      is DISALLOWED and any exception must be allow-listed by policy.
  - id: EPOL-0005
    statement: 'Evidence MUST be sufficient for independent replay: a verifier can
      re-run verification commands using only referenced artifacts, spec snapshots,
      and declared environment prerequisites.'
  - id: EPOL-0006
    statement: 'Gate Receipts as Compression: Gate reviews MUST use minimal, opinionated
      schemas that serve as machine-readable receipts pointing to artifacts; 80-95%
      of receipt content SHOULD be auto-generated by the harness.'
  - id: EPOL-0007
    statement: 'Evidence Profiles: The depth of required evidence is determined by
      profile (e.g., DEV_FAST vs HIGH_ASSURANCE); default profiles optimize for throughput
      while maintaining safety.'

  prohibited_weak_evidence:
  - A statement that tests passed without captured artifacts and verification commands.
  - Manual inspection without recorded output and without a reproducible procedure.
  - Network-dependent verification without explicit allowlisting and captured outputs.
  - Evidence that cannot be attributed to a work_id, lease_id, and policy configuration
    hash.
