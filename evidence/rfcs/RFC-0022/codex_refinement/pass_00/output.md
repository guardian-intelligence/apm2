Created the complete RFC document at:

`documents/rfcs/RFC-0022/PRINCIPAL_SOVEREIGNTY_INTERFACE.md`

It includes:
1. A full normative PSI spec (sovereignty lattice, autonomy semilattice, temporal/revocation semantics).
2. Complete protocol objects with field definitions and constraints.
3. Trust boundaries, threat model, governance gates, rollout stages, and acceptance predicates.
4. Explicit dependency contracts for RFC-0023 through RFC-0026 and theory/law/invariant traceability.

I also ran a consistency pass for objective/gate coverage, dependency alignment, and placeholder-free completion.
