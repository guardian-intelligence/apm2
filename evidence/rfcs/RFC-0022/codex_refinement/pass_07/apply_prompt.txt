A technical reviewer has analyzed an RFC and produced a set of changes with rationale and diffs. Your job is to apply those changes to produce the final, complete document.

1. Read the current RFC from: /home/ubuntu/Projects/apm2-rfc-drafts/documents/rfcs/RFC-0022/PRINCIPAL_SOVEREIGNTY_INTERFACE.md
2. Apply every proposed change below. Where the surrounding context has shifted slightly, apply the intent faithfully rather than failing on exact line matching.
3. Preserve all existing content unless a diff explicitly removes it. The document should grow, not shrink.
4. Produce the complete RFC as a single Markdown document — every section, every protocol object, every table. Not a summary, not a partial document.
