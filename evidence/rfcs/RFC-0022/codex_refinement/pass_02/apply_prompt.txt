A technical reviewer has analyzed an RFC and produced a set of changes with rationale and diffs. Your job is to apply those changes to produce the final, complete document.

1. Read the current RFC from: /home/ubuntu/Projects/apm2-rfc-drafts/documents/rfcs/RFC-0022/PRINCIPAL_SOVEREIGNTY_INTERFACE.md
2. Apply every proposed change below. Where the surrounding context has shifted slightly, apply the intent faithfully rather than failing on exact line matching.
3. Preserve all existing content unless a diff explicitly removes it. The document should grow, not shrink.
4. Produce the complete RFC as a single Markdown document — every section, every protocol object, every table. Not a summary, not a partial document.

## Reviewer analysis

### Change 1: Remove Cyclic Dependency Between Liveness Proof and Epoch Seal

**Rationale**: `HaltPathLivenessProofV1` currently includes `epoch_seal_hash`, while `SovereigntyEpochSealV1` includes `halt_path_liveness_proof_hash`. That creates a content-addressing cycle and makes deterministic hashing impossible.

**Constraints preserved**: RFC-0020 digest-first/canonicalization floors, LAW-03, LAW-15, INV-F-01, INV-F-11.

**Threat coverage**: Seal forgery ambiguity, implementation divergence, unverifiable epoch sealing under attack.

**Verification**: Deterministic hash tests for proof+epoch sealing order, replay-equivalence tests across nodes.

### Change 2: Fix Temporal Sovereignty Over-Constraint With Binding Profile Matrix

**Rationale**: Section 3.4 says *every* sovereignty artifact must carry fields that many defined objects do not carry directly. This is currently self-inconsistent and not mechanically enforceable.

**Constraints preserved**: LAW-09, LAW-15, INV-F-08, INV-F-14, RFC-0020 freshness policy model.

**Threat coverage**: False compliance, bypass through transitive field ambiguity, replay through weak epoch-key semantics.

**Verification**: Linter rule: each object classified into a temporal profile and validated against required direct/transitive bindings.

### Change 3: Clarify Hardware Kill Semantics So Safety Does Not Depend on Software Acks

**Rationale**: Current text can be read as requiring software-path success for Tier3+ kill compliance, which contradicts OBJ-PSI-01 physical independence under software compromise.

**Constraints preserved**: PHY-05, INV-F-11, INV-F-14, MECH-EMERGENCY-STOP, stop-path SLO floor from RFC-0020.

**Threat coverage**: Software veto of hardware kill, false negatives in kill-path liveness, control-plane compromise.

**Verification**: Kill-drill test where software path is intentionally degraded; hardware cut must still satisfy safety objective and produce compliant receipts.

### Change 4: Bind Containment Proofs to Exact Sovereignty Surface and Verifier Independence

**Rationale**: `ContainmentProofV1` currently lacks explicit binding to the exact sovereignty constraint surface and lacks an embedded verifier-independence attestation reference.

**Constraints preserved**: OBJ-PSI-06, LAW-08, LAW-15, INV-F-15.

**Threat coverage**: Generic/non-specific containment proofs, verifier capture, proof reuse on wrong subject set.

**Verification**: Coverage checker ensuring 100% of active sovereignty-critical surfaces are in manifest and covered by valid external proofs.

### Change 5: Complete Dual-Lattice Audit Contract (Confidentiality + Integrity)

**Rationale**: Audit request currently carries confidentiality clearance but no integrity floor. That undercuts TM-PSI-07’s dual-lattice control claim.

**Constraints preserved**: LAW-05, LAW-08, INV-F-05, INV-F-10, SP-RUNTIME-003.

**Threat coverage**: Low-integrity evidence poisoning into sovereign audit path, partial label enforcement.

**Verification**: Lattice checks in audit verifier; adversarial test where low-integrity artifact is present in range and must be omitted with proof.

### Change 6: Mechanize Verifier-Disagreement Freeze and Complete Gate Contract Registry Coverage

**Rationale**: TM-PSI-12 references dual-verifier disagreement freeze, but no enforcement algorithm or gate contract currently binds it. Also, Section 8.1 currently covers only a subset of gates listed in Section 8.

**Constraints preserved**: LAW-01, LAW-08, LAW-15, INV-F-14, INV-F-15.

**Threat coverage**: Verifier collusion/capture, silent disagreement handling, governance drift through unregistered gates.

**Verification**: Dual-verifier chaos tests with injected disagreement and outage; registry completeness lint (`all gates in §8 appear exactly once in §8.1`).

### Change 7: Make Rollout Stage Boundaries Monotonic and Non-Degenerate

**Rationale**: Stage S4 currently has identical entry/exit boundaries, and S5 reuses S4 entry boundary. That weakens HTF-gated progression semantics and can permit ambiguous stage advancement.

**Constraints preserved**: LAW-09, INV-F-14, strategy HTF boundary model in `MASTER_STRATEGY.json`.

**Threat coverage**: Silent progression without boundary crossing, governance confusion during incident rollback.

**Verification**: Stage-transition linter (`entry < exit` except terminal stage), boundary-chain replay checks.

Remaining gaps after these diffs:
1. Evidence schema contracts for the new summary fields/metrics (`sovereignty_surface_coverage`, dual-verifier metrics, integrity-floor audit checks) are still not defined and should be added before implementation.
2. `proto/kernel_events.proto` is still only “proposed” in this RFC; publication should either include companion proto patch or a binding note with explicit version target and compatibility window.
3. If RFC-0022 is expected to follow split-module RFC structure (`03_trust_boundaries.yaml`, `09_governance_and_gates.yaml`, `06_ticket_decomposition.yaml`), add a decomposition package to keep governance tooling consistent with other RFCs.
