  overall_verdict: |
    RFC-0011 v0 Discovery phase is APPROVED for transition to v2 Exploration.

    The RFC demonstrates:
    - Complete PRD requirement coverage (95%)
    - Sound architectural design with 8 design decisions
    - Comprehensive security model with 5 trust boundaries
    - Honest acknowledgment of Known Unknowns

    Council identified 4 BLOCKER findings that must be addressed during v2 Exploration:
    1. Add missing JSON dependencies (jsonschema, json-patch)
    2. Define CAC-JSON canonicalization specification
    3. Design DCP stable-ID index implementation
    4. Specify bootstrap recovery implementation details

    Additionally, 11 MAJOR findings require attention before v4 ticket generation.

    The component mapping hypothesis (currently LOW confidence) should be elevated to
    MEDIUM+ during v2 exploration through codebase investigation of the 7 discovery
    targets documented in 08_risks_and_open_questions.yaml.

  next_steps:
    - "Git commit RFC-0011 v0 Discovery files"
    - "Schedule v2 Exploration phase"
    - "Investigate Known Unknowns via codebase exploration"
    - "Resolve BLOCKER findings"
    - "Update component mapping confidence"
