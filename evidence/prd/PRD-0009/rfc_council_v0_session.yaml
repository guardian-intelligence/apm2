  verdict: APPROVED_WITH_REMEDIATION
  verdict_reason: |
    RFC-0015 v0 (Discovery) demonstrates strong foundational design with 9 well-reasoned
    design decisions addressing all identified failure modes. The 3 BLOCKER findings relate
    to expected gaps for v0 phase:
    1. Proto schema placement decision (Q-RFC-FAC-0001)
    2. OCAP context firewall integration point (Q-RFC-FAC-0002)
    3. COI grouping policy specification (Q-RFC-FAC-0003)

    All BLOCKERs are properly documented as open questions requiring resolution during
    EXPLORE phase (v0->v2 transition). The design decisions score highly across all
    reasoning modes for architectural soundness and security boundary clarity.

    Recommendation: PROCEED to EXPLORE phase contingent on resolving the 3 BLOCKERs
    as the first EXPLORE tasks.
