  authority_model:
    concepts:
      authority: Roles held by a quorum of agents to approve waivers, adjudicate decisions,
        and apply gates. Authority is granted via cryptographic identities and policy profiles.
      adjudication: An autonomous mechanism for resolving bounded choices via agent
        quorum, deterministic timeouts, and safe fallback policies.
      custody: Agent roles that produce and modify artifacts; custody is recorded
        as provenance in the ledger.
      responsibility: Domains accountable for correctness of specific surfaces; domain
        coverage is evidenced and reviewed.
      stewardship: 'Standards governance: schemas, lint, and evolution rules; changes
        require explicit signoff and changelog.'
      registrar: Role responsible for issuing and managing leases within a work scope;
        registrar keys sign LEASE.ISSUED events.
