  title: Typed error taxonomy and deterministic handling
  statement: All errors MUST be classified into a typed taxonomy with deterministic
    handling paths (retry/backoff/abort/quarantine) and safe, actionable outputs;
    no silent skips are permitted.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Every failure path emits a classified error event with a stable code.
  - Retry decisions are deterministic and based on policy and budgets; retries are
    bounded.
  - Error outputs redact secrets and include actionable remediation steps.
  - Unhandled exceptions terminate sessions and trigger supervisor classification
    and backoff.
  - Error handling behavior is covered by tests and simulated failure scenarios.
