  title: Adjudication deadlines and fallback policies
  statement: 'Every adjudication request MUST carry a deadline and a fallback policy;
    if the deadline expires without a valid quorum decision, the kernel MUST automatically
    apply the fallback policy to prevent deadlocks.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Adjudication requests include deadline_at and fallback_policy (e.g., SAFE_ABORT,
    SAFE_DEFAULT_OPTION).
  - If deadline_at passes, the kernel emits ADJ.TIMEOUT and applies the fallback_policy
    deterministically.
  - Fallback execution is recorded as a system event and attributable to the timeout
    invariant.
  - The system continues global operation without stalling when individual work items
    trigger timeouts.
