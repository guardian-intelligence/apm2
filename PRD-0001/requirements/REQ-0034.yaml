  title: Inference accounting and boundary seclusion
  statement: 'The system MUST treat inference as internal computation; evidence bundles
    MUST NOT include internal reasoning traces or raw prompts/responses. Only bounded
    accounting metadata (token counts, compute time, model ID) may be exported.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Inference syscalls (infer/*) are mediated and subject to policy and budgets.
  - Evidence artifacts contain only outcomes (e.g., code patches, test logs) and
    not the reasoning steps used to generate them.
  - If enabled, INFER.ACCOUNTING events record only model ID, token usage, and latency;
    no prompt/response content is logged to the ledger.
  - Local inference is preferred and always permitted within resource budgets; remote
    inference is strictly policy-controlled.
