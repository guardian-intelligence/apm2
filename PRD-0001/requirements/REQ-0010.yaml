  title: Vendor-agnostic agent harness adapters
  statement: The system MUST provide an adapter-based harness that can wrap heterogeneous
    agent runtimes (vendor CLIs, local models, custom loops) and normalize observability,
    tool usage, and exit classification into a standard event contract.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Adapters are isolated at a boundary; kernel does not depend on any vendor-specific
    API surface.
  - Normalized events include lifecycle, tool requests/results, filesystem diffs,
    and progress signals.
  - Adapters can operate in observation-first mode (derive progress from side effects)
    and in instrumented mode where supported.
  - Adapter output is validated against schemas before ingestion into the ledger.
  - At least two adapters (one black-box and one instrumented) can run under the same
    supervisor without kernel changes.
