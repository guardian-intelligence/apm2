  title: Template-bound artifact generation and refinement
  statement: All PRD, RFC, and ticket artifacts produced or modified by the system
    MUST conform to the unified template suite decomposition rules (file-per requirement,
    file-per evidence artifact) and be lint-valid with no unresolved references.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Generated YAML parses with exactly one root key per file and no tabs.
  - All IDs match canonical patterns and cross-file refs resolve to existing files
    and YAML root keys.
  - No Markdown tables exist in any produced Markdown artifacts.
  - The PRD and RFC requirement registries resolve every referenced requirement file
    and evidence artifact file.
  - Artifacts include deterministic ordering for all lists covered by standards determinism
    rules.
