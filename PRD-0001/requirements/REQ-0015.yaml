  title: Content-addressed artifact store with progressive disclosure
  statement: All evidence artifacts and large outputs MUST be stored and referenced
    via a content-addressed scheme (URI + hash), enabling progressive disclosure and
    deterministic verification without embedding blobs in protocol messages or ledgers.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Artifact references include sha256 and size; verification confirms hash before
    use.
  - Artifacts are stored under deterministic paths relative to bundle roots.
  - Agents receive only hashes/URIs by default and fetch content on demand per policy.
  - Artifact publication is mediated as a tool syscall and logged with provenance.
  - Artifact retention and redaction policy are enforced based on data classification.
