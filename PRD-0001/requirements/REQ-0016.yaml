  title: Evidence bundles are mandatory and reproducible
  statement: 'Completion of work, gate reviews, and significant decisions MUST publish
    evidence bundles that are reproducible: each evidence artifact includes capture
    paths and verification commands with declared network_access and timeouts.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Every PRD requirement and RFC requirement maps to at least one evidence artifact
    ID.
  - Evidence artifacts define at least one verification command that can be executed
    in an isolated environment.
  - Verification commands declare network_access and expected exit codes; failures
    are recorded and block completion unless waived.
  - Evidence bundles include a manifest tying requirement IDs to supporting artifact
    hashes.
  - Evidence artifacts are classified and include explicit redaction guidance.
