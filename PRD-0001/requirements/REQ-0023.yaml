  title: Data classification, minimization, and redaction
  statement: All collected or produced data MUST be classified (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED)
    and redacted per policy; data minimization is the default; evidence artifacts
    declare classification and redaction guidance.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Evidence manifests include classification and redaction.required guidance fields.
  - Logs and traces are scrubbed to remove secrets and sensitive inputs unless explicitly
    authorized and classified.
  - Retention policies are enforced per classification; restricted data requires explicit
    retention justification.
  - Progressive disclosure is enforced for confidential/restricted artifacts (hash-only
    by default).
  - Data handling violations are detected and recorded as policy violations.
