  title: Autonomous adjudication and quorum-signed decisions
  statement: 'The system MUST provide an autonomous adjudication mechanism to resolve
    bounded-choice decision requests via an N-of-M agent quorum; decisions are valid
    only when sufficient valid cryptographic signatures are recorded in the ledger.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Adjudication requests define a set of bounded options with associated risk profiles
    and required evidence.
  - A decision artifact is binding if and only if it carries signatures from ≥ quorum_threshold
    members of the authorized group.
  - Quorum membership and thresholds are defined in the governance profile and enforced
    by the projection reducers.
  - The system records ADJ.REQUESTED and ADJ.RESOLVED events with full attribution
    to the signing agents.
