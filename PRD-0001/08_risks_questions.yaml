  risks:
  - id: RSK-0001
    statement: Policy/syscall mediation is incomplete or bypassable, enabling agents
      to perform unauthorized side effects (exfiltration, destructive commands, uncontrolled
      network).
    impact: 'High: security compromise, data loss, and loss of trust in autonomy.'
    likelihood: Medium unless enforced early and tested rigorously.
    mitigations:
    - Implement syscall mediation as the only execution path; deny-by-default; block
      direct OS access where feasible.
    - Add continuous policy conformance tests and fuzzing of tool request decoding.
    - Treat any bypass attempt as POLICY.VIOLATION with deterministic quarantine.

    statement: Ledger and reducer complexity leads to operational brittleness (slow
      startup, projection drift, versioning bugs) that impairs autonomy.
    impact: 'High: inability to trust projections; coordination failures; expensive
      debugging.'
    likelihood: Medium; event sourcing requires discipline.
    mitigations:
    - Keep kernel event taxonomy minimal and high-signal; store blobs out-of-band
      as content-addressed artifacts.
    - Use checkpointed projections and incremental updates; provide deterministic
      rebuild tooling.
    - Define explicit schema versioning, upcasting rules, and compatibility windows
      with tests.

    statement: Autonomous merge authority causes regressions or unsafe changes if
      evidence requirements are insufficient or reviewers are too permissive.
    impact: 'High: production incidents, broken invariants, reputational damage.'
    likelihood: Medium; depends on quality gates and evidence discipline.
    mitigations:
    - Make evidence bundles mandatory and fail closed; merge requires deterministic
      checks plus reviewer validation.
    - Introduce staged rollout and rollback runbooks; require recovery evidence for
      critical paths.
    - Track regression rate and tighten profiles based on observed failures.

  open_questions:
  - id: Q-0001
    question: What is the minimal safe compatibility window and upgrade policy for
      wire schemas and reducer versions across a fleet of nodes?
    decision_needed_by: '2026-02-15'
    resolution_plan: Prototype multi-version interop tests, define upcasting rules,
      and validate with simulated rolling upgrades; capture decisions and evidence
      in RFC and CHANGELOG.
  - id: Q-0002
    question: What is the minimal authority model for autonomous merge gating that
      remains safe in the presence of compromised nodes or malicious adapters?
    decision_needed_by: '2026-02-28'
    resolution_plan: Define authority roles and required evidence categories for merge;
      test adversarial scenarios in simulation; require explicit security signoff
      for any waivers.
  - id: Q-0003
    question: What is the preferred offline inference deployment profile and how are
      model weights/provenance handled under evidence and SBOM requirements?
    decision_needed_by: '2026-03-15'
    resolution_plan: Evaluate local inference runtimes and define packaging/provenance
      requirements; add SBOM/signature evidence and policy constraints for model artifacts.
