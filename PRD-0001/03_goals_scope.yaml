  schema_version: "2026-01-23"
  template_version: "2026-01-23"
  goals:
  - id: G-0001
    statement: Enable a single-command autonomous software factory loop that produces
      merged code changes from template-bound PRD/RFC specifications with evidence
      and auditability.
    measurable_outcomes:
    - Demonstrate one end-to-end autonomous change from PRD/RFC refinement through
      merge with evidence bundle published.
    - Achieve deterministic terminal state for each workflow run (COMPLETE or ABORTED)
      with no silent skips.
  - id: G-0002
    statement: Provide a secure kernel substrate that prevents agents from performing
      unauthorized side effects and that records all decisions and outputs for replay.
    measurable_outcomes:
    - All side-effecting operations are mediated through syscalls and produce TOOL.REQUESTED/DECIDED/EXECUTED
      events.
    - Policy deny-by-default is enforced with auditable rule IDs and policy hashes.
  - id: G-0003
    statement: 'Support holonic scaling: nodes can manage workers and child nodes
      recursively, operating safely under partitions and reconciling deterministically.'
    measurable_outcomes:
    - Simulate multi-node holarchy with injected partitions and demonstrate convergence
      of lease ownership after reconnection.
    - Bound fanout and message rates to prevent runaway communication costs.
  - id: G-0004
    statement: 'Evidence-driven outcomes: every requirement and gate is satisfied
      by reproducible external evidence artifacts, proving that the desired outcome
      was achieved without requiring internal reasoning traces.'
    measurable_outcomes:
    - 100% of PRD requirements map to ≥1 evidence artifact ID with reproducible verification
      commands.
    - Automated reviewers validate completion solely from external sensory/active
      states and projections.
  - id: G-0005
    statement: Eliminate human-in-the-loop dependencies for engineering progress through
      autonomous adjudication, quorum-signed decisions, and deterministic fallback
      policies.
    measurable_outcomes:
    - Demonstrate autonomous resolution of a bounded-choice decision via agent quorum
      without manual input.
    - Validate that ADJ.TIMEOUT triggers the correct fallback_policy (e.g., SAFE_ABORT)
      in a simulated run.
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - 'APM2 node kernel: supervisor, syscalls/policy, ledger, reducers/projections,
      artifact CAS references, and federation links.'
    - HWP coordination layer sufficient to create/claim/complete work under leases
      and to manage typed questions/answers and evidence publication.
    - Template-bound PRD/RFC/ticket generation and linting using the unified template
      suite.
    - Autonomous review and merge gating based on evidence bundles and deterministic
      checks.
    out_of_scope:
    - Permissionless peer discovery and Sybil-resistant open networks (future profile).
    - Automated economic bidding/market pricing (future layer).
    - Full GUI management console as a requirement for v0; CLI and machine interfaces
      are sufficient.
    - Arbitrary untrusted code execution outside mediated syscalls; sandboxing profiles
      may be added later.
  success_criteria_summary:
  - A single command can start a workflow that completes at least one merged change
    with evidence and without manual intervention during execution.
  - No agent session can bypass syscall mediation; all side effects are logged and
    attributable.
  - Leases prevent duplicate ownership under normal conditions and converge deterministically
    under partitions.
  - Evidence bundles are reproducible and sufficient for autonomous review decisions.
